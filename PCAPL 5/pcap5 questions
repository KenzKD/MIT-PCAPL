1) Write a program in CUDA to add two vectors of length N using
	a) block size as N 
	b) N thread within a block
	c) Keep the number of threads per block as 256 (constant)and vary the number of blocks to handle N elements

2) Write a program in CUDA to sort an array in parallel using parallel selection sort and store the result in another array. 

3) Write a program in CUDA to perform odd even transposition sort in parallel.Use 2 kernels
